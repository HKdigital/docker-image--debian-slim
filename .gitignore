# Files which match the splat patterns below will be ignored by git.
# This keeps random crap and sensitive credentials from being uploaded to your
# repository.  It allows you to configure your app for your machine without
# accidentally committing settings which will smash the local settings of
# other developers on your team.
#
# Some reasonable defaults are included below, but, of course, you should
# modify/extend/prune to fit your needs!
